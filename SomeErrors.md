1) if its not a ip your host and  you use things like protford.something.something    insted of ip writing place you will get error so you have to make some changes to make it work on this type of hosts also you can use gpt to modify code a little its ezy...
2) cuz it send re conn req in every one sec after disconnections i think it only does for 2-3 mins and after that win block the open connection cuz of too many or interrupeted somehow..
3) Some errors you may found too..
