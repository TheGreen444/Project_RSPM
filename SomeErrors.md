1) if its not a ip your host and  you use things like protford.something.something    insted of ip writing place you will get error so you have to make some changes to make it work on this type of hosts also you can use gpt to modify code a little its ezy...
2) cuz it send re conn req in every one sec after disconnections i think it only does for 2-3 mins and after that win block the open connection cuz of too many or interrupeted somehow..
3) Some errors you may found too..
   // as i am not a c programmer i made this using gpt and yt and old msfvenom codes or watching some others  reverse shell codes but i just knew abut c was to print hellow world its a little bit funny haha | but somehow it is made half and i wish some exeprienced c programmer will make it better someday i hope so..
