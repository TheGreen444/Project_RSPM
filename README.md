# Project_RSPM
Project_RSPM(Reverse Shell Pro Max) :: is a persistent reverse shell payload that sends connection requests every second. Once connected, it provides a shell. If disconnected, it resumes sending connection requests until the attacker reconnects, unlike tools like msfvenom, which only offer one-time connections.
